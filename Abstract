# Abstract

The ARVR Interior Design and Space Planning project aims to revolutionize the way individuals conceptualize
and execute interior design by seamlessly integrating augmented reality and virtual reality technologies
With an emphasis on user-friendly interface and practicality,
the application will offer real-time suggestions for optimizing spatial layouts and selecting appropriate furnishings to enhance functionality and aesthetics.
By leveraging the power of ARVR, users can visualize potential designs within their physical environment, 
enabling informed decision-making and efficient space utilization.
